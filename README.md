# How to run test:
- add all unit test jars in `lib` folder to your classpath.
- I have added predefined test files under `resources` folder.

# How the solution is implemented.
- use map data structure to store file content (as a key) and list of file names (as value).
- use recursion to iterate through all sub-folders.
